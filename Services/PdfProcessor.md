# PdfProcessor (planned)

This document explains the intended role of the `PdfProcessor` service.
Originally, `PdfProcessor.cs` existed as a placeholder without implementation.
The service is expected to provide advanced PDF processing capabilities such as
text extraction, metadata handling, or preparing documents for keyword tagging.

The current application uses `PdfKeywordTagger` to locate keyword matches in PDFs.

**TODO:** Implement the `PdfProcessor` service when additional PDF processing
features are required.
